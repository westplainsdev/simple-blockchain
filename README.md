This is a simple example of keeping track of changes to an item.

## Instructions

To run the application, from the command line run:
`npm install`

To launch the application, again from the command line:
`npm start`

## Notes:

To see how a chain would be considered valid or invalid you can toggle `toggleValidity()` with the `runnerData` property of `setValidity` .
When this is done, the program will display different end results for you.
